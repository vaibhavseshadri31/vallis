HOW LIFEBOOST COFFEE INCREASED REVENUE +4,400% IN 12 MONTHS 
Lifeboost is an eCommerce brand that sells organic low-acid coffee
online. Our goal was to help them achieve profitability and scale
their revenue on Facebook and Instagram. 
  
02 
SUCCESS STORY 
We deployed an aggressive creative strategy to increase Lifeboost’s
Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) by 55% in the first month. We more than
doubled their Average Order Value (AOV) through a series of offer and
landing page tests. 
Every month was a record month for them. We grew their revenue from
$17K per month to over $765K per month while maintaining
profitability. Now over 100,000 people have tasted Lifeboost healthy
coffee. And arge percent of those people become subscribers.

INCREASING THE AVERAGE ORDER VALUE 
We knew that for Lifeboost one of the key components to stay
competitive at scale was to increase the Average Order Value. 
To increase the AOV we ran multiple tests with combinations of
bundles, price discounts and upsells. 
The biggest win we found was to offer multiple units at a higher
discount followed by one click upsell. That alone increased the AOV
over 2.5X. Now we had more room to continue with aggressive creative
testing.

AGGRESSIVE CREATIVE TESTING 
We have created over 389 videos and did 77 creative tests in 12
months. As a result we increased ROAS +55% and reduced Cost per
Purchase -64% while scaling revenue from $17K per month to over $765K
per month. 
Creative is KING. As machine learning has drastically improved and
media buying is simplified and automated, creative now is the main
driver of performance on Facebook.

When it comes to testing creative we believe that “Speed Beats
Quality”. 95% of all creative tests fail. To achieve high
performance it is crucial to produce high volume of creative and test
it fast. 
When you scale spend fast creative begins to fatigue and performance
starts to decline. To offset that we increase the volume of creative
testing and find fresh winning concepts that will maintain ROAS at
scale. 
  
06 
SCALING FAST AND EFFICIENTLY 
At this stage we had strong AOV and multiple strong creative wins that
gave us confidence to start scaling ads aggressively 
We knew that our high quality and highly engaging creative is winning
viewers in the auction against other competitors bids. 
To maximize spend and conversions fast we launched audience expansion
campaigns using CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) and highest value
bidding strategies.

One way to scale fast and efficiently that works very well for us is
Audience Expansion. The idea is to build a high volume of Lookalikes
based on different high value customer segments. Then we run our top
creative against these audiences. This allows us to tap into net new
users, reduce audience fatigue, reduce CPM, and then convert visitors
with retargeting at a higher ROAS. 
  
07 
RETARGETING AND 
CUSTOMER RETENTION 
To maintain growth month over month it is important to find the sweet
spot of your retargeting and acquisition spend. For eCommerce that
number is 30/70. That means your retargeting spend should be around
30% of total spend. 
As retargeting drives up to 3x the ROAS we allocate spend
strategically to complement the acquisition growth while hitting ROAS
target. 
To increase customer retention and Lifetime Value (LTV) we created
tailored offers and creative combinations that target different
customer segments. 
As a result customer Lifetime Value increased over +90%.
