ROAS DRIVEN CREATIVE 
STRATEGY 
 Creative Strategy   Creative Strategy  
Creative is KING. With machine learning radical improvements and media
buying being simplified, creative has become the main driver of
performance on Facebook and Instagram. 
And to achieve high performance at scale for eCommerce you need a ROAS
driven creative & testing strategy. 
For Arteza our goal was to build creative strategy that will engage
their most passionate target market - women 25+ who are into arts &
crafts. The creative was designed to attract and build an engaged
audience of high intent buyers. 
We tested a variety of engaging video concepts combined with high
converting ad copy. 
Testing a high volume of concepts is crucial to find winners fast. 
95% of all creative tested fail. To increase our success rate of
finding winners we use our internal tools built to help us leverage
competitors winning creative concepts.

Creative testing is a never ending cycle. 
We continued testing new variations and ad copy angles to improve the
control. This is the key to maintain efficiency while scaling spend.
