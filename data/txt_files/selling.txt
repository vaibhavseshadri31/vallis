What is dropshipping, and how can I dropship with Shopify?
A dropshipping business is one where the business owner lists, but doesn’t own, keep, or ship inventory. When the store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party--usually a manufacturer or wholsesaler--who then ships it to the customer directly. This means there are no upfront inventory costs for the business owner.
