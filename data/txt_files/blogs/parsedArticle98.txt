	content: ['Learn the basics of YouTube Shorts monetization and extra ways to earn money through your short-form videos.', 'Start your online business today.', 'For free.', 'Vertical short-form videos are immensely popular. You might think TikTok is responsible, but YouTube and Instagram both have successful short-form video programs as well.', 'According to Hubspot’s 2023 Video Marketing Report, short-form video content has a higher ROI and receives more engagement than any other type of video. This makes the form important—and lucrative—for brands and content creators alike. ', 'Here’s how YouTube rewards Shorts creators, plus five ways to monetize YouTube Shorts. ', 'Yes, creators can monetize YouTube Shorts. At first, Shorts were not included in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), but all video content can be monetized.', 'YouTube rewards Shorts creators with a revenue-sharing system generated from the Shorts ads they display between videos on the feed. ', 'The platform pools all Shorts ad revenue, then allocates a percentage to music partners and a percentage to YouTube Shorts creators. Creators are paid based on their individual videos’ performance.', 'Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the revenue sharing process:', 'YouTube sells ad space to companies and displays ads between videos on the Shorts feed.', 'YouTube pools all the revenue from ads showing in the Shorts feed. The pooled revenue is then distributed among creators, which is different than traditional YouTube videos. ', 'YouTube allocates a portion of Shorts revenue to its creator pool and another portion to music licensing costs. If a creator uploads a video with no music in it, all of the revenue associated with eligible video views goes into the creator pool.', 'If a creator’s content has one music track, half of the associated YouTube shorts funds will go to music usage and the other half will go to the creator pool. If it has two tracks, two-thirds of the funds will cover music usage and the remaining third goes to the creator pool.', 'YouTube allocates creator pool funds based on the percentage of views the creator generated from their Shorts content during a given time period. For example, if a creator earned 4% of all Shorts views, 4% of the funds in the creator pool would be attributed to them.', 'Each creator is paid 45% of the revenue attributed to them. YouTube retains the remaining 55% of creator pool funds.', 'It is important to know that videos that violate intellectual property guidelines, such as reposted content owned by other creators and unedited clips from TV shows or movies, aren’t eligible for monetization.', 'Creators won’t earn revenue from content that violates YouTube’s advertiser-friendly content guidelines, such as content that uses inappropriate language or is derogatory, incendiary, or demeaning.', 'To monetize YouTube shorts, creators need to be enrolled in the YouTube Partner Program. ', 'There are two levels of monetization in the YouTube Partner Program, each with different thresholds and revenue opportunities.', 'This access allows creators to sell products on YouTube. It also unlocks fan funding features like paid channel memberships, Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Super Thanks. To apply to the program you must have one of the following:', 'In addition to fan funding, creators also earn ad revenue (including YouTube Shorts monetization) and revenue from YouTube Premium subscribers. To apply to the program you must have one of the following:', 'Once you meet either of these thresholds, you can apply to YouTube’s Partner Program. YouTube will review your channel and determine your eligibility, a process that usually takes about a month. ', 'Additional eligibility requirements for the program include:', 'Once you’ve been accepted into the YouTube Partner Program, you’ll need to accept the Shorts Monetization Module to start earning funds. Here’s how to turn it on:', 'If you haven’t already accepted the Base Terms module, accept that as well.', 'YouTube launched its Shorts ad revenue sharing model in February 2023 in an effort to simplify the music licensing process and allow creators to earn more money on the platform. ', 'Various reports claim that YouTube Shorts have much lower revenue per mille (RPM), or revenue per 1,000 views, compared to long videos. On average, creators are earning anywhere between 1¢ and 7¢ RPM. By contrast, YouTube creators who make long-form videos typically average $1 to $20 RPM.', 'Here’s an example of how YouTube Shorts monetization might work for a brand or creator: ', 'In this case, YouTube allocates $116,400 to the creator pool and the remainder to the music licensing fund.', 'YouTube creators evaluate revenue using RPM. In this case, your RPM would be 13¢, or $131.85 / 1,000. ', 'Although participating in the YouTube Partner Program is the only way to earn ad revenue from Shorts, it isn’t the only way to earn money as a Shorts creator. Here’s a list of ideas to earn money.', 'Turning on YouTube’s channel memberships allows you to charge monthly payments in exchange for perks like exclusive content, live chats, badges, and emojis. To turn on channel memberships, sign in to YouTube Studio, click Earn, and visit the Memberships tab. ', 'YouTube allows creators to monetize livestreams using Super Chat and Super Stickers, which allow fans to pay to send highlighted messages or animated stickers in livestream chats.', 'Creators and brands can make money by selling merchandise online. You can sell branded merchandise (like apparel featuring your image, logo, or favorite catchphrase) or launch a product line associated with your specific content niche. Brands can use YouTube to create product videos and promote new offerings.', 'Creators typically sell products through an ecommerce platform like Shopify and continue to create and publish engaging content on YouTube to build brand loyalty, attract new audiences, and promote their products.', 'Affiliate programs pay creators for revenue associated with clicks to links hosted on the creator’s YouTube channel or another platform. For example, the Shopify Affiliate Program partners with educators, influencers, and content creators who educate their audience about entrepreneurship.', 'Brand partnerships are another method of video monetization. Instead of having YouTube sell ad space on your behalf, you interact directly with brands to negotiate sponsorship deals.', 'Typically, brands pay creators to record and publish product reviews, endorsements, or other types of content. If you’re interested in securing a paid partnership, you can develop a creator website, approach brands directly, or join an influencer platform to help brands find and contact you.', 'Get paid by brands you love with Shopify Collabs', 'Shopify Collabs makes it easy to find brands that match your vibe, build affiliate relationships, get paid for what you sell, and track everything in one place.', 'There's no set amount of money earned from 1,000 views on YouTube Shorts, because it depends on factors like location, ads, and engagement. However, creators report between 1¢ and 7¢ RPM for YouTube Shorts, on average.', 'Using the averages above, you’d make between $10 and $60 for one million views on YouTube Shorts.', 'In order to monetize YouTube Shorts, you don't need 1,000 subscribers. YouTube's Shorts Fund allows creators to get paid for their Shorts regardless of their subscriber count. You have to have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours to get the full YouTube Partner Program benefits.', 'Keep up with the latest from Shopify', 'Get free ecommerce tips, inspiration, and resources delivered directly to your inbox.', 'By entering your email, you agree to receive marketing emails from Shopify.', 'popular posts', '100+ new features to grow your business', 'popular posts']
