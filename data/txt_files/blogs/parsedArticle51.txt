Try it out.', 'For free.', 'Your logo is the face of your brand. ', 'It will appear on your website, your products, your marketing, your in-store signage, and just about any other place where people interact with your brand. It might seem like a small asset, but there’s a lot packed into it. Your brand values, products, audience, industry, background, and personality are all tied to your logo. ', 'This in-depth guide walks you through the branding and logo design process. By the end, you’ll be able to create a business logo from scratch—everything from choosing a color to making the design itself.', 'There’s no such thing as a perfect logo. Goalposts vary depending on your industry, your audience, and your brand values. However, when you’re learning how to design your logo, there are industry agnostic rules. ', 'Make sure your logo design is: ', 'Brand identity design is a catch-all term for the visual elements of your brand, including your brand colors, your logo, and the way elements of your brand are designed. These visual elements work together to distinguish your brand identity in the minds of your customers. ', 'Your brand’s distinguishing features—what’s most important to you and what will be most recognizable to your customers—lie in the answers to these questions. Before putting your pen to paper and choosing your logo colors and aesthetics, ask yourself who you are. ', 'Here are steps you can take to nail your brand identity: ', 'Getting started is often the hardest part of any creative activity. It’s good to have an idea, but sometimes the problem is having too many ideas at once. It can help to see what other brands are doing and get a feel for the kind of logos you like best. ', 'Here are some places to get inspiration: ', 'The style of your own logo should go hand-in-hand with the overall feel of your brand. It helps to think about what kind of experience you want customers to have: Do you want them to feel nostalgic? Relaxed? Inspired? Warm and cozy?', '🎨 TOOL: Create free professional logos in seconds.', 'Here are some design aesthetics you can use in your logo:', 'Classic logos stand the test of time. They bypass trends and help you reach a broader audience. The colors are usually simple and elegant, which makes your business appear reliable and professional. ', 'Vintage (or retro) logos inspire a sense of nostalgia. They often feature worn-look text, illustrations, and a muted color palette. ', 'Modern logos are fresh and minimalist. They often feature a lot of white space, minimal details, and simple lines, creating a trendy, cool feel around your brand.', 'If your brand sells quirky products to a young audience, consider a fun logo style. They’re characterized by colorful illustrations and unconventional fonts and have a positive feel to them. ', 'Handmade logos insinuate your brand is independent and leans heavily toward handcrafted goods. These logos often feature handwritten fonts, organic shapes, and line-drawn illustrations.', 'Whether you’re designing your own custom logo from scratch or using a logo template, it’s a good idea to understand the different types of logos.', 'Also known as letter marks, monogram logos are made up of letters, often the brand’s initials. Think NBC, GE, HBO, NASA. Monogram logos are simple, but help people remember the company behind the logo. ', 'For example, which is easiest to remember and say: IBM or International Business Machines? ', 'A wordmark logo (or logotype) is a font-based logo that shows the company name. Think Visa, Disney, and Jeep.', 'Wordmark logos work best for companies with catchy names. The memorable name and expressive typography create a strong brand association. They are also adaptable and can be used across different marketing and advertising materials while representing your business. ', 'Pictorial marks are graphic-based logos. Whenever you see one, you immediately recognize it as the logo of a company. The Apple fruit logo, Instagram camera logo, and the Target bull’s-eye logo are all examples of this.', 'An abstract logo mark is conceptual. It consists of a symbol that’s made just for your company. Your logo doesn’t relate to anything that exists in the world, like a bird or an apple. It’s designed to express the uniqueness of your brand. Think Airbnb, Microsoft, and Pepsi.', 'Abstract logos are hard to create if you have no design experience. It’s best to hire a professional logo design consultant who can translate colors and shapes into meaningful marks for your business.', 'A mascot logo represents your business through a character. Often, they are colorful, cartoonish, and fun. A mascot logo humanizes your brand and acts as an ambassador for it. ', 'Companies selling to kids and families, as well as sports teams, should use these designs. Popular mascot logos you’d likely recognize are Mr. Peanut by Planters, Mickey Mouse, or M&M’s characters.', 'A combination mark combines a wordmark or lettermark with a pictorial mark, abstract logo, or mascot. You then integrate them together to create the logo.', 'Combination marks help people associate your company name with a picture or icon immediately. Widely recognized combination marks include Ralph Lauren, Burger King, and Converse.', 'Color plays an important role in decision-making and brand identity. Your logo’s colors will end up on your website, in-store signage, social media feeds, marketing emails, and every other place where a user interacts with your brand. There’s no color that’s universally “better,” but each color does say something different. You want to make sure you’re saying the right thing.', 'Color psychology in logo design is used to emphasize certain product or corporate traits for specific colors. With that in mind, let’s go over the psychological effects of certain colors:', 'Brown is often associated with all-natural ingredients, homemade goods, and freshly baked treats. It’s also the color of tree bark, sticks, autumn leaves, and rich soil, so it can give an outdoorsy aura to your brand.', 'Like a roaring fire, orange radiates warmth, energy, and passion. It also tends to invoke summer—especially when paired with lighter blues and soft greens. ', 'Orange’s high-saturation sister, yellow, also gives off light, energy, and warmth. But if orange’s warmth is a glowing fireplace, yellow’s is the intense heat of a midday sun. It brings fun, positive vibes to your brand. ', 'Green can invoke an organic aura that brings to mind lush rainforests, eco-awareness, and a sense of calm. ', 'Pink is a soft gentle color often associated with femininity. It has broader connotations of kindness, romance, and love. ', 'Red is bold and unforgiving. It stands out, which is why it’s become such a dependable color in branding. Like pink, red tends to invoke romance. But whereas pink’s romance is tender and gracious, red’s romance is passionate, loud, and carnal. ', 'Purple is a shadowy, mysterious stranger with an almost magical magnetism. Given that purple dyes historically have had a reputation for being rare and expensive, there’s no mystery how purple has come to be associated with wealth, excess, mysticism, magic, and indulgence.', 'Blue tends to invoke feelings of trust, ease, and peace. That said, blue has also been shown to be the least appetizing color. Try to avoid it if you’re selling food.', 'Sometimes the best color for your brand is no color at all. Shades of black, white, and gray tend to invoke a sense of calmness, balance, or clarity.', 'Most logos are monochromatic. Single colors are easier to coordinate with, and using only one color will simplify your brand’s other graphic design elements. Monochrome logos also can be reimagined in different colors for different purposes.', 'The FedEx logo is typically displayed in blue and orange. However, the company has created alternative color logos for specific departments.', 'Here are some tools you can use to experiment with color palettes: ', 'Your logo may not include any text, but much of your graphic design will, including your web copy, signage, and a host of other branded materials. For the sake of consistency, it’s important to consider which typefaces your brand plans on using in the logo design process, even if you’re not using them in the logo itself.', 'The terms “typeface” and “font” are used interchangeably in most contexts, so it’s common to assume they’re synonyms. However, there’s an important distinction: a typeface is a characteristically distinct set of typographical symbols and characters, often divided into variant sets, like italic and bold. Each of these variant sets is a font.', 'Some logo fonts focus on style, some on historical significance, and some on endless splintered subcategories. The most common system categorizes fonts into four types.', 'When choosing your font, also consider the line thickness, whether you’ll use italicized or regular, and the mood you want to convey.', 'The shape of your final logo design is just as important as the colors and fonts you use. We subconsciously respond in different ways to different shapes, whether it’s a circle or a square. Here are some common logo shapes and what they might signify: ', 'The creative process is different for everybody. Some may start with sketches, while others might jump right into Adobe Illustrator. The drafting phase involves a lot of trial and error, so don’t get discouraged if things aren’t working.', 'At a certain point, you’re going to start to feel like you can’t even recognize letters from shapes or good logos from bad. When this happens, it might be time for feedback. Feedback is incredibly important to the creative process because it’s the only method creators have of “testing” their ideas. ', 'For the best feedback, ask specific questions about how each person perceives your brand based on the company logo. Being told your logo is “good” or “bad” won’t be helpful, but knowing how your brand comes across will be.', 'Here are some questions to ask when getting feedback:', 'It’s hard for someone to be certain of how they’d react to your brand in real life, so avoid questions like, “Would you buy this?” or “Is this interesting?” More specific questions will garner more specific answers and better feedback. ', 'Now you have your feedback and your initial designs, it’s time to decide on your final logo design. Easier said than done. When choosing the right design, think back to the elements that make a good logo and ask yourself:', 'Ready to show the world your brand new logo? Here are some tips for integrating it seamlessly throughout your business.', 'Your logo is the face of your business, so it needs to reflect your brand, your audience, and your products all in one simple, memorable graphic.
