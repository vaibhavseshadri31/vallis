	content: ['The vintage clothing market is booming, thanks to throwback trends and conscious consumers looking for alternatives to fast fashion. Learn how to meet demand and start your own vintage business.', 'Start your online business today.', 'For free.', 'If you live for the thrill of scoring a 1970s-era dress at your local thrift store for next to nothing, selling vintage clothing online might be right for you. Having an eye for sourcing and curating vintage is a skill—and it could have benefits beyond your unique wardrobe. ', 'Vintage shoppers rely on store owners to do the tedious sifting, curating a painless browsing experience of only the best items, in the best condition. And, with rapidly shifting consumer consciousness about where clothes come from, selling vintage clothing is a sustainable business opportunity with a growing market. ', 'This guide will walk you through each step to building your own brand, and teach you how to sell vintage clothing online—and everywhere else. You’ll learn where to source products, photography tips, pricing strategies, and more, with industry advice from successful vintage sellers.', 'In the US, the secondhand market is projected to more than double by 2027, reaching $350 billion. The demand has contributed to the success of brands like ThredUp and the growing number of vintage clothing sellers popping up on Etsy and eBay. ', 'While there is a lot of competition, there’s no reason you can’t create a unique vintage brand to define your particular taste, away from the crowded marketplaces. But before you get started selling vintage clothing, be sure you understand the terminology.', 'There are a few terms you need to understand as you consider starting a business selling vintage clothing online. ', 'In this guide, you’ll learn how to sell vintage clothes with help from founders of four successful vintage clothing businesses. Through their stories, glean best practices for sourcing vintage items and setting up your own business.', 'Every successful business starts in the same place: with a great small business idea. While you may just elect to pick and sell what you like, consider choosing a niche within the vintage clothing world to help your business stand apart. ', 'You may choose to sell vintage clothing within one of the following niches:', 'Dayna Atkinson, founder of FYRE VINTAGE, found her groove in reimagining vintage pieces by cutting them apart and stitching them back together in new ways. “I have a good mix of regular vintage and reworked vintage, which makes my shop unique,” she says.', 'Once you’ve landed on a niche, run it through a series of tests before you commit: ', 'Building a solid brand for your vintage business will help you find a relevant audience, create a guide for future hires as you expand, and keep your focus consistent.', 'It’s important that you define your vintage clothing brand at this early stage. Answering a few questions will help you tell your brand story, carve out your visual aesthetic (or brand identity), capture your mission, and more clearly envision your ideal customer. ', 'You will continue to reference your brand guidelines as you design your site and curate your collection. And, as you scale and hire staff, these guidelines will also help keep your messaging consistent. ', 'Today’s tools and technology mean you can launch your vintage business from your home with very little initial investment. ', 'This is, however, a business model that requires you to buy inventory upfront—unless you opt for a consignment model (paying for the items after they are sold). You can also bootstrap and sell vintage clothing piece by piece on an online marketplace, using sales to buy more inventory.', 'As you scale, consider how long your living space will be able to handle your storage needs, and plan ahead for when you may need to upgrade to a dedicated office or warehouse space.', 'Seán Domican and Oisín Manning started Durt Co. Vintage with personal savings and bootstrapped as they grew. They are careful to closely manage cash flow. Due to the nature of the business, having cash on hand is essential for buying one-of-a-kind stock as it becomes available. ', 'There are a few ways to source inventory when you are looking to sell vintage clothing. These include thrift stores, auctions, and wholesalers. Let’s explore the number of ways to buy vintage clothing items.', 'When you’re starting out in the world of selling vintage clothes, local thrift shops can be excellent sources of vintage finds. If you have the patience and eye for scouring racks and don’t need a ton of inventory, start there. There are a few best practices for finding vintage clothes to sell online. ', 'OMNIA founder Naomi Bergknoff still hits thrift stores whenever she travels, and her clothing is picked from a number of sources, including collectors and her customers. Regardless of the source, she says she’s always selective: “I’m always thinking about what I’m attracted to and what I know my customers will like to see.”', 'Don’t stop at thrift shopping. There are many places to find treasures if you’re willing to dig. Here are a few options to consider:', 'Vintage clothing wholesalers generally get their stock by picking from thrift store cast offs that end up in overseas rag houses. Pickers then cull any items that can be sold to vintage shops through wholesalers. ', 'In Ireland where Seán says vintage hasn’t quite caught on the way it has in other parts of the world, the options were slim for Durt. Finding a wholesaler gave them access to bulk vintage clothing—and they can review the stock virtually. “Someone has a tripod with a camera and they just go through clothes and pick for you,” Seán says.', 'The team behind COAL N TERRY also built wholesale relationships to free up their time and expand the business. “They already know what kinds of things we are looking for,” co-founder Azeezat Owokoniran-Jimoh says. “Sometimes we get high-fashion brands.” ', 'Without a plan, vintage inventory can start to feel like a disorganized thrift store. Unlike stores with limited product listings (and multiple units within each), vintage clothes are usually one of a kind. Once you start scaling selling vintage clothes, a messy system can be detrimental to efficiency.', 'Develop a system to help sort, store, and identify items to simplify shipping and fulfillment. Processing incoming vintage clothing in batches, Durt stores items using a numerical system—each new piece is tagged, numbered, and placed on racks in order. “Now we know where it is if someone orders it,” says Seán. ', 'Even though you’re selling vintage clothing—essentially a used product—customers will expect that your items arrive clean and in the condition described. If there are permanent stains, rips, or other damage, they may still have value and be desired by a customer. But be sure to clearly describe and photograph the damaged areas to avoid surprises—and returns.', 'Product photography in a vintage business is an ongoing task. Unlike other clothing stores that may schedule shoots once per season or as new collections are released, vintage merchants have a steady intake of inventory, all of which needs to be individually shot. ', 'COAL N TERRY’s owners do all of their clothing photography in-house with a basic fixed studio setup, including a DSLR, tripod, simple lighting kit, and white seamless background. The setup is permanent, which means that the photography looks consistent on collection pages, even though the items may have been shot weeks apart. ', 'If you’re planning to sell vintage clothing from home or in a small space like an apartment, a permanent studio setup may be unrealistic. In this case be sure to keep your equipment stored in one place for easy setup and tear down.', 'Take note of tripod placement, camera settings, and lighting conditions so you can recreate the look each time you shoot. And, shoot in batches (say, weekly or biweekly) rather than item by item. ', 'You may decide that your photo skills aren’t up to scratch and you’d rather work with an existing studio. Do some upfront prep to maximize your studio time. “I plan out the outfits a day or two before the shoot and put them on the rack in the order I want to shoot them in,” says Dayna.', 'Follow these guideline to help you get the most out of your photo shoots:', 'When you sell vintage clothes, follow the same basic rules for pricing products for ecommerce—be sure to factor in the cost of the item and other overhead and expenses. But forget standard pricing formulas (multiplying wholesale cost by X), because you also need to factor in vintage clothing value. ', 'Each piece will need to be considered independently, but you may want to stick within a specific range, depending on your ideal customer. “I make an effort to keep my pricing consistent so my customers know what to expect,” says Dayna.', 'Price vintage clothes according to:', 'The best way to determine selling price is to search for similar vintage items on vintage marketplaces like eBay or Etsy. Are there a ton of the same? Your selling price decreases. Is your item in better condition than others like it? Your selling price increases. ', 'For very old, rare, or couture items, consider an appraisal service or consult experts in the vintage community. “It’s rare that we have a piece that requires appraisal,” says Naomi. “But once in a while I’ll ask fellow vintage dealers for their expertise.” You don’t want to miss a rare gem and sell vintage clothes far below their value.', '💡Tip: Check Google trends and keyword search volume to see if there is actually demand for the item. Your piece may be rare, but if there’s not much demand, that could affect your pricing.', 'You’re now ready to set up a basic website on a platform like Shopify to start selling vintage clothes online. Most ecommerce platforms have a free trial so you can play around before committing. Let’s dig into some of the steps to building your website.', 'When setting up your first Shopify store, you can easily customize the design with your own branding without needing to code. There are several standard Shopify themes to choose from—some free and some paid—that you can tweak with colors, fonts, and custom navigation.', 'As you grow, you may choose to customize your site even more. If you need help with code or design, consider hiring a Shopify Expert.', 'Don’t forget to invest in your About page. This is the place where your brand story lives; it tells your customers what you’re about (decades you focus on, your inspiration, etc.), and it could share information about your mission, your sustainability statement, and links to your FAQ and Contact pages. ', 'Your FAQ page should clearly indicate that vintage items are used/worn and one of a kind. This is a great place to educate your customers on sizing, garment care, and your condition ratings. You may also use this page as a one-stop shop for shipping and customer service information, such as postal rates per country and your return policy.', 'Product page copy is incredibly important for setting customer expectations when you sell vintage clothing. It also can improve SEO (search engine optimization), and minimize returns. Vintage clothes require more specific information than new clothing, like measurements, history, and condition. “Every item and body is unique, so finding ways to effectively communicate what a garment is through a website is key,” says Naomi. ', 'Collection pages will help organize your online store and keep it from looking like a rummage sale. Consider organizing vintage clothing inventory into collections by era, color, occasion, item type, or season. “We do specialty collections around seasons, holidays, and various themes,” says Naomi. This exercise will also help with SEO and navigation.', 'When you launch, be sure your website is ready to receive traffic. Seán and Oisín generated hype around their business by building social audiences prior to launch, and they weren’t ready for the impact. “After one of our TikTok videos took off, a stream of people were visiting the unfinished site,” says Seán. ', '“Something that helped me over the years was diversifying where I sold,” says Naomi. “Mixing online with in-person events and vintage markets was a great way to bridge the gap with local customers, move product, and make new connections.”', 'There are multiple online selling sites for vintage clothing brands, and the good news is that you don’t have to pick just one. Having your own dedicated website gives you full control over design, is helpful for reaching customers through organic search, and acts as a hub for your brand. ', 'With Shopify, you can integrate with marketplaces like Etsy that have audiences seeking vintage items. Apps for clothing stores help sync your inventory across multiple sales channels. ', 'Reach customers everywhere they are with Shopify', 'Shopify comes with powerful tools that help you promote and sell products on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google, and YouTube from one back office. Make sales on multiple channels and manage everything from Shopify.', 'Durt opted to sell only to customers in Ireland, where the founders say competition for vintage is low. If you don’t have a dedicated retail space, look for other opportunities to sell in person, like a local clothing and vintage market or a pop-up booth at festivals.', 'There are several ways to get the word out and attract customers to your store—some paid, some organic. ', 'The beauty of one-of-a-kind is the availability of content. With new items arriving constantly, COAL N TERRY uses Instagram to quickly get iPhone snaps in front of its loyal customers right away.', 'Azeezat and Dare grew their business on social media without spending money on any formal advertising. They rely on shoutouts from celeb or influencer partners, and user-generated content in the form of customer photos. “We actively ask customers to share their photos,” says Azeezat. Durt sends vintage clothing to influencers in Ireland. “We never really ask people to post,” says Seán. “But 90% of the time they post anyway.”', 'Dayna similarly has had success with Instagram, using the platform to announce product drops.', 'A post shared by FYRE VINTAGE (@fyrevintage)', 'Depending on your audience and personality, you may have success marketing your products on video-based platforms like TikTok or YouTube. Try showcasing new products or taking fans behind the scenes.', '“The weekly newsletter is successful in driving traffic to our new arrivals,” says Naomi, who uses email marketing as a way to communicate when new batches have dropped. Email marketing is a great tactic for rewarding repeat customers, giving them advance access to new vintage clothing items or other loyalty rewards. ', 'When building your site, invest time in organic marketing strategies. Understanding SEO and how to use it to send organic traffic to your site is a great way to grow your business when you’re on a budget. That means considering the keywords and search terms your customer might be using to find you.', 'You can also drive traffic through your site with content marketing. Use blogs or short video and create content that answers questions, weighs in on a relevant topic, or cashes in on a popular meme. Relevant, consistent, and timely content can help you build an audience and gather email leads.', 'You’re in a great position as a vintage clothing reseller to have a revolving door of new and unique items constantly hitting the site. Investing in your existing customers is key because there will always be something new to help bring them back. Consider setting up customer accounts, reward programs, and discounts.', 'Little extras tucked in your unboxing experience can inspire delight in your customers and get them sharing their experiences with friends and online.', 'Setting up a shipping strategy means deciding where you’ll ship, the carriers you’ll work with, the rates and options you’ll offer to customers, and how you’ll handle returns for your vintage clothing business. ', 'Sustainability is something more and more consumers are considering as they shop. If you’re attracting customers based on the sustainable nature of vintage, you can take it a step further by using sustainable packaging for your shipping.', 'Sell internationally in minutes with Shopify Markets', 'Shopify Markets helps you sell to multiple countries and scale your business internationally—all from a single Shopify store. Manage store localization, shipping, duties, and compliance all in one place.', 'Now that you’re armed with everything there is to know about selling vintage clothes online, is it still the right business for you?

Source vintage clothes from thrift stores, auctions, or wholesalers. Then, set up your own online store and market to your target audience.', 'You can sell vintage clothing online through your own dedicated ecommerce store.
