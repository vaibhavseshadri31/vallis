Learn about this and more in our guide.', 'Start your online business today.', 'For free.', 'As a store owner, your ecommerce conversion rate might be the ultimate indicator of your business’s viability. It is a fairly simple concept to understand, but not easy to improve. However, a great ecommerce conversion rate is crucial to your store’s success.', 'A conversion occurs when someone takes an action on your website that you wanted them to take. Every website and its digital marketing team decides what they define as a conversion.', 'You might consider conversions to be when potential customers engage with pop ups. You might also refer to someone ordering a product as a conversion. It’s up to you.', 'Typically, businesses label actions that measurably impact their online business as ecommerce conversions. This usually focuses on either orders or activities in which someone shares their contact information, such as their email, which allows you to continue to market to them.', 'Average ecommerce conversion rates are around 2.5% to 3% according to industry leaders, but that doesn’t mean this is your business’s sweet spot. Having a baseline of 2.5% is a good place to start, but keep working to optimize this with conversion rate tactics.', 'The Shopify analytics app LittleData did a comprehensive survey of Shopify stores’ conversion rates and found the average conversion rate for Shopify stores is 1.4%. If you have below 0.5%, you likely have room to improve, and if you are above 3.3%, you have a very good ecommerce conversion rate—in the top 20% of all Shopify stores.', 'When someone refers to an ecommerce conversion rate, they are referring to the conversion rate of orders on a store. This is represented via a more specific formula:', 'Ecommerce conversion rate = orders / visits to your website', 'So if you have 1,000 visits to your site, and in 50 of those visits there’s an order, your ecommerce conversion rate is (50 / 1,000) = .05 or 5%.', 'Depending on what data source you’re looking at, you may see this metric called something different. Google Analytics refers to it as “ecommerce conversion rate,” so this has become the most common name. ', 'But in Shopify’s Analytics, we refer to it as “online store conversion rate,” and other analytics tools may refer to it as the “transaction rate” or “order rate.” They all mean the same thing.', '', 'Example of ecommerce Conversion Rate in Google Analytics', '💡 TIP: Use Shopify’s built-in reporting and analytics to help you make better decisions, faster. Choose from more than 60 pre-built dashboards and reports, or customize your own to spot trends, capitalize on opportunities, and supercharge your decision making.', 'A conversion rate is the percentage of the total number of visits to a website that result in a conversion action. It’s expressed as a percentage and calculated via a simple formula:', 'Conversion rate = number of specific actions taken in a period of time / total number of visits to your site in the same period of time', 'So if your conversion action is subscriptions to your newsletter, and in a period you have 1,000 visits to your site and 100 newsletter subscriptions, your conversion rate is 100 / 1,000 = 0.10, or 10%.', 'There are a few common misunderstandings people have when defining ecommerce conversion rate:', 'When someone visits your website, most analytics tools refer to this as a “session” and identify the person (or their device) as a “user.” If you visit a website on Sunday, then come back again on Monday, you would be one user who had two sessions. Ecommerce conversion rate is calculated using the number of orders and sessions in a period, not the number of users. If you report ecommerce conversion rate using users, the rate will be inflated. Some marketers have begun advocating the use of users instead of sessions, especially for high-priced stores where most users need multiple sessions before converting, but the industry norm continues to be sessions.', 'A website’s overall conversion rate is the percentage of visits (sessions) that take any conversion action. This includes orders but can also include actions like newsletter subscriptions, presale signups, or add to carts. A website’s overall conversion rate will typically be higher than its ecommerce conversion rate, which refers only to orders.', 'Learn more: The Beginner’s Guide to Website Personalization (+ Top Shopify Apps)', 'A website’s ecommerce conversion rate can be measured through a website analytics tool. Google Analytics is the most common and focuses on website-only data. However, there are many possible ways to track the metric. Here are other common ones:', 'Most analytics tools work the same way—they provide a snippet of code for you to add to your site, which (with input from a marketer or developer) interprets when a session starts and finishes and when an order occurs. ', 'The right analytics tool for you depends on a combination of your budget, acquisition channels, and ad spend level (high ad spends require more complex analytics and attribution tools).', 'Most marketers will choose regular intervals to measure their ecommerce conversion rate. Setting a regular review cadence helps marketers avoid overreacting to fluctuations and understand trends. Here are common review cadences of ecommerce conversion rates:', 'Review only to see if there are any major dips or spikes that might indicate something on the site is broken. (A spike could mean, for example, a product is accidentally listed as “free.”)', 'Review for opportunities to improve conversion rate. This includes reviewing whether certain product categories or landing pages have higher conversion rates, whether there are new features (such as review apps) that could improve conversion rates, or areas to A/B test.', 'Review for opportunities to make strategic, larger differences in the conversion rate. This can include strategies for better communicating the store’s value proposition, rebranding, redesigning the user experience, or involving time-sensitive sales and product releases.', 'The exception to a regular interval of review is after a large marketing campaign. This could be a holiday sale, new product release, or large influencer collaboration. Marketers can learn more about the impact of the campaign by comparing it to previous campaigns or to non-campaign periods.', 'The idea of a universal benchmark for ecommerce conversion rates is a fallacy. A conversion rate isn’t just driven by the quality of the store’s experience, and a higher rate doesn’t always mean better. Here are a few things that will affect how you benchmark your ecommerce conversion rates:', 'Sites that drive a high volume of traffic from ads or blog posts will typically have a lower conversion rate than sites that rely on traffic from existing customers or social media followers. This doesn’t mean the ad or blog-driven sites are worse—they are just introducing more people to their brand for the first time.', 'Sites with more expensive products will typically have lower conversion rates than those with fairly inexpensive ones. Making a bigger purchase typically requires more consideration on the part of the consumer than a cheaper, impulse purchase might, since it requires a larger share of their income. The common belief in marketing psychology is that average conversion rates begin to decrease first after $50, then again after $150 and $500.', 'Ecommerce stores that sell subscription products will typically have lower conversion rates than those selling one-time purchases. This is because consumers need more time to think about the commitment, but also because the subscription stores typically have fewer visits from returning customers.', 'However, it can still be helpful to benchmark your store against an overall average to understand your performance. ', 'Ecommerce businesses mostly refer to conversions as a completed sale. You could also consider a newsletter signup a conversion, but for the sake of this walkthrough, a conversion will be an ecommerce sale.', 'To calculate your conversion rate:', 'Look at the total number of visitors on your website over a period of time. You can use tools like Google Analytics to track your site traffic. Include all visitors, regardless of whether they made a purchase or not. ', 'Track the total number of completed sales over a desired time frame. You can find this number in your Sales report in the Shopify admin.', 'Now, calculate the conversion rate by using the following formula:', 'Conversion Rate = (Total Conversions / Total Visitors) x 100', 'For example, if you had 1,000 visitors on your website and 20 of them made a purchase, your conversion rate would be (20 / 1,000) x 100 = 2%.', 'Remember to be consistent with the time frame you’re analyzing. If you’re calculating the conversion rate for a particular month, ensure both the number of visitors and conversions are for that same month.', 'Conversion rate optimization (CRO) is an incredibly in-depth subject deserving of its own guide. ', 'However, if you are just getting started with CRO for your site, here are some tips for improving your conversion rate:', 'Your value proposition, or unique selling proposition (USP), is the single most important factor in your conversion rate. If you have a fantastic, unique product and messaging that fulfills a need for your customers, your site visitors will tolerate a lot of other imperfections in the experience in order to get your product. Review your site and ask yourself, “Is it clear what my product is and why they need it?”', 'Friction refers to any part of the user experience that is overly difficult or confusing. This includes everything from a poor checkout process to unclear shipping fees. Any individual piece of unneeded friction can drastically affect a site’s conversion rate.', 'This is particularly important for newer sites and brands. Customers can’t see or touch the product you’re selling ahead of time, so they need extra assurances about quality before making a purchase. Stores can address customer anxiety with clear return/guarantee policies, social proof such as reviews, or immersive AR shopping experiences.', 'Lower shopping cart abandonment by simplifying the checkout process, being transparent about costs, and offering guest checkout options. Use strategies like automated emails or remarketing ads to remind customers to complete their purchase.', 'Make sure your site is mobile-friendly, with easy navigation, fast load times, and clear call-to-action buttons (CTAs). Simplify checkout with mobile payment options to provide a superior customer experience and boost conversions.', 'Identify and monitor key performance indicators that align with your objectives. Think about metrics like conversion rate, average order value, cart abandonment rate, and customer lifetime value. Correct tracking helps you understand your business’s performance and guides strategic decisions.', 'Tracking your conversion rates is simple, but not easy. ', 'Measuring your ecommerce conversion rate really is as straightforward as counting the number of orders in a period relative to the sessions. But avoiding measurement pitfalls, establishing a benchmark and review cadence, and improving the rate over time, can feel anything but easy for ecommerce websites. Merchants that can do all this, however, have a powerful new set of tools to take their stores to new heights.', 'Keep up with the latest from Shopify', 'Get free ecommerce tips, inspiration, and resources delivered directly to your inbox.', 'By entering your email, you agree to receive marketing emails from Shopify.', 'popular posts', '100+ new features to grow your business', 'popular posts']
