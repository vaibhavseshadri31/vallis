How do you get their attention?', 'In this guide, learn how to get more Instagram followers (not bots) by creating content and how to increase engagement on your Instagram posts, Stories, and Reels.', 'Marketers say Instagram is the second most important social channel for marketing, behind Facebook, and 80% report that they use the channel to promote their businesses. Getting the most from your marketing dollars, however, starts with building a loyal and engaged audience of followers on Instagram.', 'While follower count is only one success indicator on Instagram, increasing followers can unlock monetization opportunities for influencers and provide businesses with valuable social proof. ', 'Instagram started as a photo sharing app, quickly getting into video with its Stories feature. Stories are a more intimate form of vertical-format video, viewable only to friends, followers, and visitors to your page. Reels, however, are public-facing, offering more reach through Explore on Instagram and, therefore, viral potential. ', 'Brands and creators should consider adding Reels to their Instagram strategy due to their high engagement rates compared to Instagram posts. Average likes on Reels is 42% higher than that of posts, and Reels see four times the number of shares over posts. ', '“Reels give anyone the opportunity to reach new target audiences,” says Trilce Jirón Garro, owner of social media marketing agency TBS Marketing. “Creators can produce community-driven content that builds trust, gains followers, and makes sales over time.” ', 'On the heels of TikTok and the popularity of its unpolished video format, Reels offer brands and creators a chance to be more candid and human. To create content for Reels, keep these tips in mind:', '“Don’t sell your products through Reels content,” says Trilce. “Share facts. Provide tips about the industry you’re in.

And, if one of your TikTok videos goes viral, try it (or a similar concept) on Instagram to help you get more followers.', 'Why is this important? While some of your audience may overlap, you will have unique followers on each social app. “There are different people on different platforms,” says Hugo Amsellem, angel investor and adviser at Jellysmack. “The overlap is only 10% to 20%. You’re not going to repeat the same message to the same person across different channels.”', 'In an interview with Modern Retail, Nadya Okamoto, founder of lifestyle period brand August, said, “As we’ve grown on TikTok from August, we’ve also grown to 175,000 followers on Instagram.” Actively posting on multiple platforms has affected August’s customer acquisition cost (CAC), allowing the brand to steer away from paid media as its main acquisition channel. ', 'TikTok isn’t the only channel you can cross-post on. The Instagram Reels format translates well to YouTube Shorts and Pinterest Stories. If you’re cross posting, however, make sure you understand the preferences in each community and tweak to accommodate.', 'Instagram users will likely discover you through your content when it appears on the Explore page. If they’re compelled to learn more, they’ll navigate to your profile. This is a critical step in gaining a new follower. That’s because a strong brand is a signal to potential customers and followers that your account is for them (or not). ', 'Your Instagram profile is one of many touchpoints along the customer journey. Your brand should therefore show up in the same way it would on your ecommerce website, other social channels, your product packaging, and customer communications. ', 'Everything from your avatar to your Instagram bio to your content grid matters. “Your Instagram feed serves as the billboard for your brand. It’s a customer’s first touchpoint with you and captures the essence of your brand,” says Trilce.', 'Ask yourself:', 'On Letterfolk’s Instagram profile, consistent color palette and graphics give the account a professional look.

The chances of standing out from other popular accounts using this tag are slim—and it may not even be relevant to your brand. ', 'A better strategy is finding hashtags that are relevant to your brand and content. Research hashtags and keywords within your industry and get to know which hashtags your target audience is using. ', 'A social media hashtag generator tool like Iconosquare or Later can help you find hashtags for your business account. These are paid apps that help you generate suggested hashtags based on popularity and relevance. ', 'If you’re on a budget, you can still find relevant hashtags by typing target keywords into the search bar in the Instagram app. Try different keywords that describe your brand and products, building out your hashtag keyword list as you go.', 'Doing competitor research is another hashtag discovery tactic.
