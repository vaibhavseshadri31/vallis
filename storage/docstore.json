Select items that align with what\nyou\u2019re already selling and what your customers want.\nUNDERSTAND YOUR MARKET\nThe first step in expanding your product range is to understand your\nmarket. Through competitive analysis, you can identify what other\nbusinesses in your industry are offering and how they are marketing\ntheir products. This information will help you determine which types\nof products will appeal most to your target audience.\nFor example, if you sell handmade jewelry, consider expanding into\naccessories like scarves or handbags that complement your existing\nproduct line. \nAlternatively, if you specialize in home decor items like candles or\nwall art prints, consider adding furniture pieces or bedding sets to\noffer your customers a complete room makeover experience.\nDIVERSIFY WITHIN YOUR NICHE\nYou don\u2019t have to completely abandon your niche when diversifying\nproduct offerings. Instead, focus on broadening your selection within\nthat niche. For instance:\n     If you sell organic skincare products with natural ingredients from\nlocal farmers\u2019 markets, consider adding hair care essentials and\nbody lotions made from similar ingredients sourced locally by small\nbusiness owners who share similar values with yours.\n     If coffee beans are the mainstay of your online shop, why not\nintroduce tea blends? Both drinks offer unique experiences but still\nfall under the umbrella category of hot beverages.\nCreating multiple stores for different product ranges within your\nniche not only offers flexibility in managing diverse product lines\nbut also opens up opportunities for flash sale events which can\nsignificantly boost sales volume.\nLOOK FOR PRODUCT IDEAS IN THE SHOPIFY APP STORE\nBesides researching competitors and looking at complementary niches,\nthere\u2019s another way Shopify merchants find new ideas: the Shopify\napp store offers over 6,000 apps designed specifically for Shopify\nstores.\nSome of these Shopify apps offer product suggestions based on your\nexisting customers\u2019 shopping habits and preferences, while others\ncan help you streamline your inventory management.\n_Screenshot: Shopify App Store_\nBy selling a range of different products, you\u2019ll be able to attract\nnew customers while also keeping existing ones engaged with fresh\nofferings.\n2.

If\nyou\u2019re not catering to this audience, you\u2019re missing out on a\nsignificant chunk of potential customers. \nAdditionally, Google prioritizes mobile-optimized websites when\nranking search results.

USE OLD SCHOOL EMAIL MARKETING\nEmail marketing may seem like an outdated strategy, but it remains a\ncrucial component of any successful online business. In fact, email is\nstill the most effective way to reach customers and potential\nclients. \nHere are some tips on how to grow your Shopify store through an\neffective email marketing campaign.\n     BUILD YOUR DATABASE: To get started with email marketing, you need\na database of subscribers who have opted in to receive your emails.\nThere are many ways to build this list: you can offer incentives such\nas discounts or freebies in exchange for sign-ups, add opt-in forms on\nyour store\u2019s site, or use pop-ups that appear when visitors land on\nspecific pages.\n     CREATE ENGAGING CONTENT: Once you have built up your subscriber\nlist, it\u2019s time to start sending out emails that will engage and\ninterest them. Make sure each message has a clear purpose and call to\naction. Use catchy subject lines that grab attention and personalize\nthe message whenever possible.\n     SEGMENT YOUR LIST: Not all subscribers are in the same customer\njourney stage \u2013 some may be existing customers while others might be\nnew leads who haven\u2019t made a purchase from your Shopify store. To\nensure maximum effectiveness, segmenting your list into different\ngroups based on their interests or behaviors can help tailor messages\nspecifically for those groups.\n     AUTOMATE WHERE POSSIBLE: Automating certain aspects of your email\ncampaigns can save time while also increasing efficiency and\nengagement rates among recipients \u2014 especially if they\u2019re tailored\ntowards abandoned carts or other customer behavior triggers.\n     OPTIMIZE FOR MOBILE: More than half of all emails today are opened\non mobile devices so optimizing templates and designs ensures a\nseamless experience on smartphones and tablets.\nEmail marketing is still an effective way of reaching out to both new\nand existing customers. By sending targeted emails based on customer\nbehavior, you can encourage repeat purchases from existing customers\nwhile also attracting new ones through special offers, promotions, or\nexclusive content.\n5. SELL YOUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY ON FACEBOOK\nOne underrated tactic in how to grow your Shopify store is selling\nproducts directly on Facebook.\nFacebook is a great platform to market and promote your Shopify store.\nWith over 2 billion monthly active users, it provides an enormous\npotential audience for you to reach out to. However, simply sharing\ncontent on Facebook may not be enough to get the desired results.\nHere are a few tips on how to grow your Shopify store on Facebook:\n     TARGET SPECIFIC AUDIENCES: To ensure that your posts are reaching\nthe right people, use the custom options provided by Facebook\u2019s\nadvertising tools. These tools allow you to target specific\ndemographics based on age, gender, location, and interests among other\nfactors. By doing so, you can make sure that only those who are most\nlikely to be interested in what you have to offer will see your\nposts. \n     CREATE ENGAGING CONTENT: Creating engaging content is crucial when\nmarketing on Facebook. Your posts should be short and sweet but also\nvisually appealing with high-quality images or videos. Make sure that\nthey provide value or entertainment for the reader while still\npromoting your products effectively. \n     HIGHLIGHT SOCIAL PROOF: Another effective strategy when marketing on\nFacebook is highlighting reviews or testimonials from existing\ncustomers to show potential buyers how good your product really is.\n6. MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE BLOG PRESENCE\nRunning an active blog is a powerful way to grow your Shopify store.\nThis isn\u2019t just about posting regularly \u2014 it\u2019s about providing\nvaluable information that engages readers and encourages repeat visits\nand purchases.\nYour blog can be the heart of your online community, fostering a sense\nof belonging around your brand.\nBlogging can be a great way to flaunt novel items or offer advice on\nhow to get the most out of your products.\nStudies have shown that businesses with blogs generate more leads, so\nthis is definitely something you should consider if you\u2019re looking\nto boost conversion rates.\nIn addition, search engines love fresh content, which means\nmaintaining an active blog can help improve your SEO ranking too.\nA higher ranking equals greater visibility \u2014 driving organic traffic\nto your store and ultimately increasing sales figures.\nIf done right, blogging can become one of the most effective tools in\nyour marketing arsenal. It not only drives profits but also\nestablishes a strong online presence for your brand long-term.\nIf you don\u2019t have time (or money) to update your blog regularly, you\ncan use an AI writing tool like Content at Scale so you can maintain a\nfresh stream of content with minimal effort without sacrificing\nquality.\nIf you\u2019re wondering how Content at Scale compares to other AI tools\nlike ChatGPT, here\u2019s a quick breakdown of why it\u2019s actually BETTER\nfor long-form content creation and blogging:\n content at scale vs chatgpt  content at scale vs chatgpt \n7.

PRODUCT SPECIFIC POPUPS\nProduct-specific popups are one of the best ways to promote a product\nbecause they focus the attention of customers on specific items. \nExamples:\nAn email signup popup that focuses a product to motivate visitors to\nconvert\nA popup with a link to drive shoppers to a page with a product\nA popup that shows a product only to visitors who viewed it before\nLet\u2019s see all of these in action:\nFlaus is promoting its product (the world\u2019s first electric flosser!)\nwith an email signup popup on the homepage. The campaign is featuring\na nice product image, a unique value proposition, and a nice discount:\n flaus product promotion popup \nThis product promotion example is great if you, for example, sell one\nor a few items.\n(By the way, Flaus used Wisepops to make that popup).\nNext\u2014\nThis campaign (a popup for driving traffic) is different. \nInstead of a generic \u201csign-up-for-our-newsletter\u201d message, this\nproduct popup promotes the item TO THE VISITOR WHO HAS VIEWED THAT\nPRODUCT BEFORE. So, it won\u2019t appear, for example, if you visit the\nsite for the first time.\nThe visitor can just click Shop Now and go straight to the product:\n product promotion popup \nShowing products to returning visitors like that is easy to do with\nPAGE TARGETING.\nYou just need to add your chosen product page to campaign display\nsettings in your popup app, for example:\n page targeting \nSee how to do PAGE TARGETING\nAnother advantage of this product promotion popup is the unusual\nposition\u2014zero interference with the browsing experience.\nMany businesses, especially ecommerce websites, advertise products\nwith similar campaigns, especially shown in unusual positions.\nAnother example:\nDolce & Gabbana promotes a popular product like that:\n dolce gabbana popup box \nCreating these non-intrusive ecommerce popups is also easy with a good\npopup software, and you\u2019ll be able to capture your visitors\u2019\nattention and drive traffic to product pages easily.\nIn fact\u2014\nYou can choose the position of a product promotion popup with one\nclick in Wisepops:\n display settings \nIf you\u2019d like to try promoting products with popups, there are\nplenty of popup software out there. \nBut let me recommend WISEPOPS.\nWisepops is made for marketers and business owners\u2014it\u2019s simple to\nuse and you can create and publish any popup in minutes.\nBesides, you get a suite of pro features like unique Shopify discount\ncodes, A/B testing, targeting of Klaviyo segments, and deep targeting.\nTry popups free\n_No cc needed, unlimited free trial._\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\"A brilliant dashboard that helps you create any popup you want within\nan hour or even less, it took me 15 min once I knew the offer that I\nwanted to show.\"\n_Wisepops review from Capterra _\n3. DISCOUNT POPUPS\nUnlike product-specific popups, these ones are all about discounts.\nWhile discount popups can be a bit interrupting (that depends on the\ndisplay settings, though), they are a proven way to promote products\nby giving visitors an incentive.\nExample:\nDiscount popups are a part of the product promotion strategy at Blume,\na successful Shopify store. This one gives 20% off for the first order\n(note an image with products, too):\n discount popup \nThis way, Blume visitors know right away that they can get a good\ndeal.\nAnd this strategy works\u2014\nBlume CONVERTS 5% OF VISITORS with this campaign (see the case study\nbelow).\nThere\u2019s also one more reason why this Blume campaign is successful.\nIf a visitor decides to close the popup and browse products first\n(which happens all the time!), they can still easily GET THE DISCOUNT\nWHEN THEY NEED IT. \nHere\u2019s how: when they close the popup, it automatically changes into\na very small tab that stays in the left bottom corner of the screen.\nIf the visitor finds the product they like and wants to get the\ndiscount, all they have to do is click that tab:\n popup with tab \nI won\u2019t go into details but here\u2019s HOW THE TAB WORKS if you\u2019re\ninterested.

BLOG CONTENT\nYou can promote your products with long articles, videos, short posts,\nhow-to guides, listicles, and other blog content.

So, follow\nthis guide closely, and present your products in the best possible\nway.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF RESIZING IMAGES FOR SHOPIFY\nIt is crucial to grasp the significance of resizing images for a\nShopify store before delving into the process.

The presence of better product images will not let\nvisitors bounce from your store, and you will get a good ranking on\nSERPs and more organic traffic.\n     When a visitor clicks a site and gets consistent product images\nthroughout the store, it creates an impression of professionalism.

So, if you give something different from usual\nto your customers, it will benefit you for sure.\n     As per a study, 90% of shoppers abandon carts if the site loads\nslowly. It happens when the user is not getting good treatment.\nSpecifically, for a shopping store, large-size images negatively\nimpact the user experience. To reduce cart abandonment, it becomes\ncrucial to optimize images of all the pages of the store.\n     If there are high-quality and relevant images on your site, the user\nwill stay longer and engage with your content. This increased user\nengagement can lead to lower bounce rates and higher CTRs, which send\npositive signals to search engines, and these factors contribute to\nthe higher ranking of your site.\nThese are some reasons you should go for image resizing. But which\ntool would be best to do it? Let\u2019s know in the above segment.\nSHOPIFY\u2019S IMAGE RESIZER TOOL\nMany tools are available in the market, free as well as paid-for image\nresizing.

Let\u2019s shed some light on how it\nempowers businesses to present their products in the best way and stay\ncompetitive in the digital marketplace. \n     SUPERCHARGING WEBSITE PERFORMANCE: One can expect a faster loading\nsite after optimizing images of their store. The user experience can\nbe enhanced, which plays a greater role in the success of ecommerce\nbusiness stores.\n     RETAINING IMAGE QUALITY: Shopify\u2019s image resizer tool helps in\noptimizing pictures of any format. Moreover, quality remains\nuncompromised during the optimization process.\n     SEO: Another advantage of optimizing through image resizer by\nShopify is that it automatically adds alt tags, which helps in the\noptimization of image filenames and improves the SEO of the store.\n     CONSISTENT BRANDING: The presence of consistent product images\nthroughout the store creates a visual identity. Thus, consistent\nbranding can be easily achieved through the process.\n     BULK RESIZING (MAX OF 6): One can resize the pictures of their store\nin bulk by using a simple image resizer. This saves time and ensures\nconsistency throughout the store.\nIMAGE ASPECT RATIO: THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR WHILE RESIZING IMAGES\nFOR SHOPIFY\nOne crucial aspect you cannot skip while resizing is the Image Aspect\nRatio. It plays a pivotal role in preserving image quality and\nensuring a seamless user experience.\nThe aspect ratio is basically the proportion between the image width\nand height. You can maintain a professional and polished look for your\nShopify website by maintaining the same aspect ratio for all your\nproduct images.\n     To ensure the consistency of your site and make it visually\npleasing, you can lock the ASPECT RATIO OF AN IMAGE IN HTML. Choose\nthe desired \u201cwidth\u201d and \u201cheight\u2019 attributes. However, this\noften leads to stretched or distorted images if not used carefully. It\nwould be better if you handle it with CSS.\n     The correct way to set the ASPECT RATIO OF AN IMAGE USING CSS is to\nspecify the width and set the height to \u201cauto.\u201d It helps in\nscaling the image proportionally while maintaining the aspect ratio. \nHere\u2019s the CSS code you can provide:\n    img {\nwidth: 400px,\nheight: auto\n}\nThis code will ensure that the image width is fixed at 400 pixels, and\nthe height adjusts automatically to maintain the aspect ratio.\n     Another great way to maintain the aspect ratio is by using the\n\u2018ASPECT-RATIO\u2019 PROPERTY, which is a relatively new CSS property\nthat allows the store owner to set the preferred aspect ratio for an\nelement.\n For example:\nAspect-ratio: 2 / 1\nAs per your mentioned command, the aspect ratio will be adjusted.\nBut, one thing is to be noted here, your browser should support this\nproperty. Before proceeding, check the compatibility with the browser\nyou intend to support.\nIf compared, using CSS to set the aspect ratio is a more flexible and\nreliable approach to using HTML attributes. However, it all depends on\nthe browser compatibility when implementing new CSS properties.\nPOPULAR IMAGE RESIZER APPS FOR SHOPIFY\nWe don\u2019t want your knowledge to be constrained to one tool.

This way,\nyou can avoid distortion of images when resizing in a Shopify store:\n> OVERLY LARGE IMAGES: Images taken from a camera are usually of\n> higher resolution and quality. But, if the same ones are on the\n> website, these will slow down the loading times. So, better\n> customize them before directly uploading from camera or stock\n> photos.\n> \n>      DISREGARDING THE ASPECT RATIO: Distortion or stretching of an\n> image occurs when the aspect ratio is ignored, which can make your\n> website appear unprofessional and unappealing. Therefore, it\u2019s\n> important to maintain the original aspect ratio when resizing\n> images.\n> \n>      FORGETTING TO COMPRESS: It is important to compress an image even\n> though you have resized it. As resizing does not always compress\n> images. You are advised to reduce its file size while maintaining\n> acceptable quality.\n> \n>      NOT SAVING A BACKUP: It is the biggest mistake to lose the\n> original, high-quality version of images after resizing.  But\n> keeping a backup lets you have a high-quality version for future use\n> or modifications.\n> \n>      INCONSISTENT IMAGE SIZES: The presence of inconsistent images\n> leads to a disjointed and unprofessional appearance on any website.\n> These disrupt the visual appeal in actual terms. So, consistency is\n> the key to maintaining a professional and real scenario. \nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nConclusively, you are now fully equipped with all the necessary\ndetails for resizing images on Shopify.

Also, Google likes fast websites\nbecause they make users happy. If your Shopify store loads quickly,\nit\u2019s not just cool\u2014it\u2019s like a magic key for more sales. In\nshort, fast load times make both users and search engines think your\nwebsite is a winner.\nIn this blog post, we\u2019re covering everything about speeding up your\nShopify store. First, we\u2019ll dive into what slows down a store\u2019s\nloading speed. After that, we\u2019ll share strategies to tackle those\nissues. \nGet ready to level up your store\u2019s speed and performance!\nWHAT IS SHOPIFY SPEED OPTIMIZATION?\nThe images, code, and other assets that affect the loading time of a\nstore are optimized through a process called Shopify speed\noptimization. The main purpose is to get fast loading speed and better\nperformance of the store.\nLet\u2019s dive into the advantages that come with a faster-loading\nonline store.\nBENEFITS OF OPTIMIZING YOUR SHOPIFY STORE PAGE SPEED\nShopify speed optimization is just like greasing the wheels of your\nonline success. From enhancing user experience to getting higher\nsearch engine rankings, speed optimization can bring many benefits to\nyour store. \nLet\u2019s dive into the advantages that come with a faster-loading\nonline store.\n     USER EXPERIENCE: Customers in digital stores are attracted to\nproducts, which is why they arrive there. If they get the desired\nresults quickly, they will think not to go elsewhere, as everyone\nwants to save time. Thus, faster loading of the site decreases the\nbounce rate and creates a pleasant experience for users.\n     INCREASED SEARCH ENGINE RANKING: Speed is one of the main ranking\nfactors by Google, and in the case of Shopify stores, apart from\ngetting conversions, the goal is also getting user attention, and that\nis possible by maintaining a good search engine ranking. Hence,\nincrease your store\u2019s loading speed and enjoy top ranking in\nSERPs.  \n     MORE SALES ON SHOPIFY: When real users have a slow experience while\nshopping, whether on a phone or laptop, they are less likely to\npurchase from you, not even in the future. Thus, a slow site is\nequivalent to a missed selling opportunity. Make it load within 3\nseconds and get a lesser abandonment rate and more sales on your\nShopify store.  \n     BETTER CUSTOMER RETENTION: First impression matters a lot. Imagine a\nvisitor viewing your store, but it takes a higher loading time than\nusual. In the future, if they see your store\u2019s mention in SERP, they\nwill not even bother to view it as they have a bad experience in their\nmind. However, if the converse happens, they will think to shop from\nyour site whenever they need the product. Hence, having a fast-loading\nstore and owning high-quality products is necessary.\nYou will enjoy these benefits if your store has good speed and less\nloading time. But, before letting you know the procedure\u2019s method,\nwe want to discuss some common factors affecting website speed in the\nnext segment.\nCOMMON FACTORS THAT AFFECT WEBSITE SPEED\nTo strengthen anything, we have to work on each of its weakest parts.\nJust like the strength of a chain is determined by the strength of its\nweakest link. That\u2019s why we will discuss each factor that affects\nthe website speed.\n     HOSTING PERFORMANCE: The first thing you need to do to create a\nsuccessful business is to choose a good web hosting service. This\nservice is like the foundation of your online presence. When picking a\nhosting provider, two important things to consider are where their\nservers are located and how much storage and RAM they offer. These\nfactors affect how fast your website\u2019s content gets to your\nvisitors. So, choosing a hosting provider with a server closer to the\ntarget audience and sufficient resources can solve the issue of slow\nloading times.\n     SERVER RESPONSE TIME: The quicker the server responds to the\nuser\u2019s request, the better will be your website speed. If the\nresponse time from your server is fast, you can give your site\nvisitors a snappy user experience.\n     SHOPIFY IMAGE SIZES: Oversized images lead to a slow website.\nSometimes, stores optimize images through the right Shopify image size\ntechniques but forget the hidden ones, like product variants, which in\nturn slows down the speed. \n     CODE EFFICIENCY: Complex or inefficient code impacts the overall\nstore\u2019s speed.  But, if there is clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\ncode, your users can render the information quicker. Minimizing\nunnecessary code, reducing HTTP requests, and optimizing code help in\nachieving all this.\n     REDIRECTS: Unnecessary redirects frustrate users as these increase\nthe loading time. But, if you minimize them and instead use 301\nredirects for permanent changes, you will be closer to your goal.\n     CACHING: Some elements get saved automatically on your customer\u2019s\ndevice if your store caches. When they return to your online store the\nnext time, the browser loads resources from the cache instead of\nsending another request to the server. Images, PDFs, JS files, and CSS\nfiles can be cached, and loading time for returning visitors can be\nimproved.\n     THIRD-PARTY APPS AND PLUGINS: The use of third-party apps and\nplugins introduces additional code that slows down the site. So, if\nyou are not using any app, then better disable it. Otherwise, its\ncoding can affect your store\u2019s speed and performance.\nSo, these are the general factors that overburden the loading of a\nwebpage. But, if you improve them for product pages and your store\u2019s\nhome page, you will provide your customers with a simple and seamless\nexperience. \nCONDUCT A SPEED AUDIT FOR YOUR SHOPIFY WEBSITE\nFrom here on, the actual procedure starts, and that too, with a\ncomprehensive Shopify SEO audit -focused on speed. This is the first\nstep where you will check how well your site shows up on search\nengines. \nYou can use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix.\n an example of a stores Google page analytics report \nCheck the KPIs like \u201cFirst Contentful Paint,\u201d \u201cTime to\nInteractive,\u201d \u201cTotal Blocking Time, and \u201cLargest Contentful\nPaint.\u201d\nDetermining these factors will help you identify high-impact issues\nand uncover specific bottlenecks affecting speed. \n", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 6399, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cf60eb0-abb2-437b-aaad-847523435509": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cf60eb0-abb2-437b-aaad-847523435509", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../data/txt_files/best_practices/speed_optimization.txt", "file_name": "speed_optimization.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 26181, "creation_date": "2024-02-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-06", "document_title": "Mastering Shopify Speed Optimization: Boosting Performance and Increasing Sales", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Here is the answer.\n compress resize and reduce images and media files \nUsing lightweight embedded videos designed for fast loading and\nminimal data is a good idea for displaying product videos on your\nwebsite. These video formats are ideal for people with slower internet\nconnections or mobile devices with limited data plans.\nFurthermore, Shopify has its own recommended image sizes for optimal\nperformance. Product images, collection images, theme images, and\nthumbnail images, all have specific resolutions. For more detailed\ninformation, you can refer to guidelines on Shopify image sizes.\nRelated read: See the Shopify Image Optimization guide to learn how to\noptimize images for a fast-loading website. \nLIMIT THIRD-PARTY APPS AND PLUGINS\nOne can use as many as required third-party apps and plugins for added\nfunctionality in their Shopify store. But, while enhancing\nfunctionality and user experience, they slow down a site\u2019s loading\nspeed and impact its performance. They make requests to external\nservers or load additional scripts, increasing the page load time;\nthis situation worsens, especially for mobile devices with slower\ninternet connections.\nThus, it becomes essential to maintain a balance between the features\nand site performance. Consider keeping only those apps whose benefits\noutweigh their impact on the site speed. Also, remove any inactive\napps, as these only negatively impact the store. Deleting them will\nhelp in reducing the clutter and improve your site\u2019s speed.\nYou should also check if there are two or more apps performing similar\nfunctions in the store. If there are, then consider consolidating the\nfeatures into a single app so that the number of requests can be\nreduced.\nMOBILE OPTIMIZATION\nAround 80% of shoppers buy from their mobile devices. So, you cannot\nskip the importance of optimizing a site for them, as the users expect\nand prefer to fast-load websites only. On the contrary, they get\nfrustrated and bounce back if they get slow loading times. But, if you\nwork for the site\u2019s optimization, you can provide visitors with a\nsmooth and speedy experience.\nIn addition to boosting user engagement, faster loading times can\nenhance your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) performance and increase\nyour visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). Moreover, when\nyour website loads quickly on mobile devices, it\u2019s more likely that\ncustomers will complete their transactions, leading to higher sales\nand revenue.\nHere\u2019s how you can achieve a mobile-optimized Shopify store. \n     Choose a theme that is designed to adapt and display well on various\nscreen sizes and mobile devices, i.e., a responsive theme. And\nluckily, Shopify offers many such RESPONSIVE THEMES.  \n     After selecting the best one, ensure that it works well on mobile\ndevices and provides a seamless user experience. Especially, check for\nissues like layout problems, small text, and difficult navigation. \n     The next step you should follow is to compress the store\u2019s images\nfor mobile devices. You can use compression tools or apps to reduce\nthe file size of your product images without sacrificing the quality.\nMINIMIZING CSS AND JAVASCRIPT CODE\nThe next strategy we will discuss is the presence of compressed and\nclean CSS, JavaScript, and Liquid files in the site\u2019s coding. If\nthese files are compressed, one can improve their store\u2019s\nperformance, user experience, and maintainability. Some of its\nbenefits are reduced page load times, enhanced mobile optimization,\nand a positive impact on SEO.\nIt would be a good idea to merge and minify these files to achieve\nthese benefits. Let\u2019s go deeper and make you understand better.\n     You can combine multiple CSS or JavaScript files into a single file.\n", "start_char_idx": 8274, "end_char_idx": 12006, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73df43d6-d87a-4f3f-8527-ba3ef016d117": {"__data__": {"id_": "73df43d6-d87a-4f3f-8527-ba3ef016d117", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../data/txt_files/best_practices/speed_optimization.txt", "file_name": "speed_optimization.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 26181, "creation_date": "2024-02-06", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-06", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-06", "document_title": "Mastering Shopify Speed Optimization: Boosting Performance and Increasing Sales", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

It includes images, CSS files, JavaScript\nlibraries, and fonts.\n     PRELOADING HINTS: The web developers put hints to the browser about\nthe resources to be preloaded. For this, they use HTML link elements\nand HTTP headers. The resource\u2019s type, location, and significance\nare specified through this.\n     RESOURCE LOADING: The moment the browser encounters these hints, it\nstarts fetching and loading the specified resources in the background.\nThe resources are generally stored in the browser\u2019s cache.\n     IMPROVED TTFB: As the significant resources are already in the\ncache. When the browser encounters references to them in the page\u2019s\nHTML, the TTFB is reduced. With this, the browser starts rendering the\nwebpage faster, and there is a quicker loading time and a better user\nexperience.\nBENEFITS OF PRELOADING\n     Faster Page Load Times: With preloading critical resources, users\nperceive the website as faster and more responsive, which, in turn,\nspeeds up the overall page loading time.\n     Improved User Experience: When users get what they want in less\ntime, it gives a positive impression on their minds, and they prefer\nengaging on that site.\n     Reduced Latency: Users with slower internet connections face issues\nwhile browsing an online store.

However, some special cases exist where\nintegrating an external CDN can be beneficial.\nYou will need an external CDN for the following reasons:\n> HIGH GLOBAL TRAFFIC: Shopify\u2019s CDN handles a wide range of\n> traffic levels worldwide, but if the store gets exceptionally high\n> global traffic, in that case, an external CDN is required.

It will reduce the round-trip time for data between the\n> user\u2019s device and the server. So, your remote users will get a\n> fast-loaded webpage.

It doesn\u2019t just determine which\ntype of food is best based on the unique needs and health issues of\neach shopper\u2019s dog, it also advises shoppers about the appropriate\nportion size for their dog.\nThis quiz works well because although dog owners care deeply about\ntheir pets, they might lack the knowledge about what types of natural\ndog foods are best. After all, making the switch from commercial dog\nfood can be complicated, and the right diet for each dog depends on\nage, breed, and many other factors. People really appreciate the\npersonalized recommendations provided by The Farmer\u2019s Dog.\nLet\u2019s take a look at how their quiz works.\n  The start of the Farmer\u2019s Dog quiz  The start of the Farmer\u2019s\nDog quiz  \nThey ask lots of questions about your dog, including their breed,\npersonality, weight, daily activity, what they like to eat, and if\nthey have any health issues.\n  The Farmer\u2019s Dog quiz  The Farmer\u2019s Dog quiz  \nBased on your answers, you\u2019ll get a customized meal plan with the\nperfect recipes for your dog. Notice how they use your dog\u2019s name in\nthe copy\u2014and squeeze in 2 reminders about the special 20% off offer.\n  The results of the Farmer\u2019s Dog quiz  The results of the\nFarmer\u2019s Dog quiz  \nThe Farmer\u2019s Dog also customizes the package you receive by adding\nthe name of your dog to the label and precisely portioning each pack\nof food for the size of your dog.\n2. SAVE SITE ABANDONERS BY ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS\nIn general, visitors who have spent significant amounts of time on\nyour site are very interested in your brand and products, even if they\nhaven\u2019t decided to make a purchase yet. That\u2019s especially true if\nthey\u2019ve started to fill out a quiz. \nIn The Farmer\u2019s Dog\u2019s case, a visitor who\u2019s reached this stage\nof the customer journey has a dog and is probably interested in\nstarting to feed them healthier meal options. \nIf someone who fits this profile plans to leave the site without\nfinishing their purchase (or completing the quiz), The Farmer\u2019s Dog\ntries to rescue that conversion. \nUnlike most ecommerce companies, they don\u2019t go about this by\ndoubling down on trying to sell the visitor a product before they\u2019re\nready. Instead, they just offer help. \nHere\u2019s what their exit-intent popup looks like:\n  The Farmer\u2019s Dog exit-intent popup  The Farmer\u2019s Dog exit-intent\npopup  \nFor example, if you click on \u201cI want to see the price,\u201d this is\nwhat you\u2019ll see: \n  The Farmer\u2019s Dog exit-intent popup second page  The Farmer\u2019s Dog\nexit-intent popup second page  \nBut if you click on \u201cI want to see the recipes\u201d instead, you\u2019ll\nsee this: \n  The Farmer\u2019s Dog exit-intent popup second page  The Farmer\u2019s Dog\nexit-intent popup second page  \nThese popups accomplish a few important things at once:\n     They address visitors\u2019 concerns and answer common questions.\n     ", "start_char_idx": 2090, "end_char_idx": 5433, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a32604c-c787-482a-8bfc-f6f503caa00a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a32604c-c787-482a-8bfc-f6f503caa00a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../data/txt_files/case_studies/farmers_dog.txt", "file_name": "farmers_dog.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 12305, "creation_date": "2024-02-05", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-05", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-05", "document_title": "The Comprehensive Marketing Strategy of The Farmer's Dog: Disrupting the Dog Food Industry and Revolutionizing Delivery and Personalization", "questions_this_excerpt_can_answer": "1.

Here are some examples:\nThe Farmer\u2019s Dog takes a different approach with customers who\nfinish the quiz but don\u2019t make a purchase. \nThey send this segment of visitors an automated email that offers 50%\noff the first purchase.

This means it can be more difficult to get\npeople to take the leap and sign up.\nThe Farmer\u2019s Dog offers a trial discount for new customers: 20% off\nthe first purchase. \nThe purpose of this discount is to help new customers decide if the\nmeals are really what they expect (and see whether their dog truly\nloves them).\nOffering a discount on the first purchase is a great way to decrease\ncustomers\u2019 fear because they can try your product for less. And once\nthey know what they can expect from you, they\u2019re usually happy to\npay full price. \nAccording to Jonathan Regev, CEO of The Farmer\u2019s Dog, offering a\ntrial discount is a way of expressing confidence in their product,\nwhich potential customers pick up on. \nIn his words, \u201cthat trial essentially says, \u2019Hey, we stand behind\nour product. You can try it.\u2019 So, most people aren\u2019t looking at\nthe trial like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just get this because it\u2019s on sale.\u2019\nIt\u2019s more like, \u2018I wonder if this company really does what they\nsay they do.\u2019\u201d \n  A sticky banner on The Farmer\u2019s Dog website that promotes their\n20% off discount  A sticky banner on The Farmer\u2019s Dog website that\npromotes their 20% off discount  \n4.

However, are the\nstores real or they are merely hype? Wouldn\u2019t it be possible to\nexperience a real case study of Shopify without a fluff?\nI have invested in a niche eCommerce store with a special emphasis on\nluxury fountain pen brands and fountain pens. As the CEO of the\nGoldenSpot Pens, let me share with you, for the very first time, how\nthe Shopify store was built and grew by 7 figures.\nHow We Built the Shopify Store to Maximize Conversations and Traffic\nThe structure of a site receives less attention as much as the\neCommerce space is concerned. Having incorporated the correct\ntechnical SEO into the framework site is important, including the\ndevelopment of a site that ensures a conversion rate of more than\n2.00%. This is a demanding technical skill that will involve the\ninvolvement of seasoned developers and professional marketers.\nSEO Structural Site\nOrganic traffic increases by having a technically intelligent site\nstructure with a better understanding of the Google website. The site\nstructure refers to the way a website is arranged with navigations,\ncategories, and URLs, which should be simple and delineates things\ninto easy categories. The top of the silo had the main products types.\nIn our case, it included fountain pens and bottled ink, journals and\nnotebooks and cases, and pen pouches. The fountain pens consist of\nvarious hundred brands of fountain pens that can easily attract\nthousands of monthly traffic.\nOptimizing The Site for Conversions\nThe fountain pens represented our niche eCommerce store and were\noptimized the site for conversions. Since our website is older, we\nstarted with ideation. Ideation involved redeveloping our website by\nre-imagining the site, We hired a professional designer and we work as\na team to make the site appear amazing and pretty. The Shopify\nplug-ins are reviewed and we bought extra plug-ins. We reviewed the\ncheck-out experience in ensuring the checkout is easy as possible. We\nwitnessed a massive improvement after implementing a premium\n\"suggested products\" for every purchase made.\nEstablishing A YouTube Content Strategy\nThe GoldenSpot Pens employed YouTube as a marketing channel. Despite\nthe fluctuation of YouTube between niches, it was still possible to\ndevelop a coherent strategy utilizing YouTube. YouTube remains to be\nthe largest social media platform at the moment and its organic reach\nis higher than nearly any other platform such as Facebook and\nInstagram continue to reduce their organic reach compared to the ads.\nA YouTube Channel was created in which, we attracted more than 2700000\nviews and 20000 subscribers that demonstrated their love for\nGoldenSpot Pens. YouTube is all about valuable content and\nconsistency. Consistency is related to publishing at least once per\nweek to ensure the YouTube algorithms favor our channel.

Wouldn\u2019t it be great to see a\nreal shopify case study without fluff?\nI am the CEO of Goldspot Pens, a niche ecommerce store specialising in\nfountain pens and luxury fountain pen brands. I\u2019m going to share\nwith you, for the very first time, how we built up our shopify store\nand grew it to over 7 figures.\nHOW WE BUILT OUR SHOPIFY STORE TO MAXIMISE TRAFFIC AND CONVERSIONS.\nSite structure does not get talked about as much as it should in the\necommerce space. Having the correct technical SEO implemented into\nyour site\u2019s framework is crucial, as well as developing a site that\ngets conversion rates above 2.00%. This can be a demanding technical\nskill involving the engagement of professional marketers and seasoned\ndevelopers\n Goldspot pen Photo credit: Goldspot\nSEO SITE STRUCTURE\nHaving a technically intelligible site structure leads to a better\nunderstanding of your website by Google, in-turn increasing your\norganic traffic. What is site structure? It\u2019s the way your website\nis organised with URLs, categories, and navigation. Site structure is\nhow the different pages on your site are linked together, determining\nhow Google bot goes through your site as well as how page rank (link\nauthority) spreads to the rest of your site. Typically a good site\nstructure for SEO is simple and delineates things into easy\ncategories.\nWhat are the main types of products you sell? For good ecommerce site\nstructure, you want to make a silo that goes from the most general\ncategories to the more specific product categories and products\nthemselves. Use the main product types you sell as the top of the\nsilo. For us, this is fountain pens, fountain pen bottled ink,\nnotebooks and journals, and pen pouches and cases. Under fountain\npens, we have hundreds of brands of fountain pens you can easily get\ntoo and that each acquire thousands of monthly traffic.\nOPTIMISING YOUR SITE FOR CONVERSIONS\nA major advancement in our niche ecommerce store (focused on fountain\npens) was optimising our site for conversions. We began from step 1,\nideation. Especially if your site is older, you need to decide if you\nshould have a new site developed. This involves re-imagining your\nsite, and is something that you can\u2019t easily just hand off to a\ndeveloper. You need to hire a professional designer and work\none-on-one with them to get your site looking amazing.\nHaving a pretty site is just one element of ecommerce conversion\noptimisation. There are many steps you should start proceeding with.\nBegin reviewing which shopify plugins you should buy or try. Review\nyour checkout experience to make sure it is optimizing for additional\npurchases and makes the checkout experience as easy as possible. We\nsaw a massive improvement by implementing a premium \u201csuggested\nproducts\u201d after each purchase.\nESTABLISHING A YOUTUBE CONTENT STRATEGY.\nAnother major marketing channel we used for Goldspot Pens was Youtube.\nYoutube fluctuates between niches, but if it is possible to develop a\ncoherent content strategy utilising youtube, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\nYoutube is one of the biggest social media platforms right now, and\nit\u2019s organic reach is greater than nearly any of the other platforms\n(as instagram and facebook continue to lower their organic reach in\npreference to their ads). We created a Youtube channel that has\nacquired over 2,700,000 views and over 19,000 subscribers that love\nour Goldspot Pens brand.\nYoutube content is about two things: consistency and valuable content.\nConsistency is simple, you need to be publishing at-least once a week\nfor the youtube algorithm to favor your channel.

BUILD AN EMAIL LIST FROM DAY ONE\nHappy Box began to build an email list as soon as their online store\nwas up and running\u2014even before they had any email marketing\ncampaigns! \nHannah and Ariel knew that email communication with their customers\nwas valuable. This user engagement strategy lets you retain users\nfor longer. For that reason, they made it clear that users would get\ncoupons if they signed up.\n\u201cConsumers are so used to it, and almost expect it,\u201d said Hannah,\n\u201cthat they\u2019re not just going to just sign up. You have to give\nthem some kind of incentive.\u201d\nIf you\u2019d like to grow your list by offering incentives, try one\nthese popups for free:\nCurrently, Happy Box sends two emails a week to their subscribers.\nThey mix storytelling about their brand and products with discount\noffers. \nFor example, their welcome email immediately rewards subscribers with\na $3 off coupon.\n  A Happy Box welcome email  A Happy Box welcome email  \nThey also offer entertaining stories or valuable information in the\nemails.
